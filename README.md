* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Lists
* String manipulation
* User input handling
* Modules (importing files)

**Description:**

In this project, the computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list. The player guesses one letter at a time. If the guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the word; otherwise, the player loses a life. The game continues until the player either guesses the complete word or runs out of lives.

**Example:**

* Word: _ _ _ _
* Guess: a → Correct
* Guess: z → Wrong
* Lives left: 5
...
* Result: You Win 🙂 / Game Over 

## Day 8 - Caesar Cipher ##

**Concepts used:**

* Functions
* Loops
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Lists and indexing
* String manipulation

**Description:**

In this project, the user can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message. The program shifts each letter of the message by a given number (shift value). It also handles wrapping around the alphabet (e.g., after "z" comes "a"). The user can run the program multiple times to encode or decode different messages.

**Example:**

* Message: hello
* Shift: 3
* Encrypted: khoor

* Message: khoor
* Shift: 3
* Decrypted: hello

**What I learned**:

* How to create reusable functions
* Understanding basic encryption logic
* Handling edge cases (like wrapping around alphabets)
* Improving program structure and readability

## Day 9 - Secret Auction Program ##

A program that simulates a secret auction where multiple users can place bids, and the highest bidder wins.

**Concepts used:**

* Dictionaries
* Loops (while loop)
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Functions
* User input handling

**Description:**

In this project, multiple users can enter their names and bid amounts. Each bid is stored in a dictionary with the user’s name as the key and their bid as the value. After all users have placed their bids, the program determines the highest bidder and displays the winner.

**Example:**

* User 1: Alice → Bid: $300
* User 2: Bob → Bid: $500
* User 3: Charlie → Bid: $450

**Winner: Bob with a bid of $500**

**What I learned:**

* How to use dictionaries to store and manage data
* Looping through data to find maximum values
* Building interactive programs with multiple users
* Writing functions for cleaner and reusable code

## Day 10 - Calculator Program ##

A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

**Concepts used:**

* Functions
* Dictionaries
* Loops (while loop)
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Recursion (optional continuation logic)

**Description:**

In this project, the user inputs two numbers and selects an operation (+, -, *, /). The program performs the calculation using functions stored in a dictionary and displays the result. The user can continue calculating with the result or start a new calculation.

**Example:**

* First number: 10
* Operation: +
* Second number: 5
* Result: 15

* Continue with 15 → * 2
* Result: 30

**What I learned:**

* How to use functions for different operations
* Using dictionaries to map operations with functions
* Creating continuous programs using loops

**Concepts used:**

* Functions
* Loops (while loop)
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Random module
* Variables and scope

**Description:**

In this project, the computer chooses a random number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100). The player selects a difficulty level (easy or hard), which determines the number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback like "Too high" or "Too low" until the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.

**Example:**

* Chosen number: (hidden)
* Guess: 50 → Too low
* Guess: 75 → Too high
* Guess: 63 → Correct 

**What I learned:**

* Understanding variable scope (local vs global)
* Using functions to organize code
* Implementing game logic with conditions
* Providing user feedback for better interaction


## Day 14 - Higher Lower Game##

**Concepts used:**

* Functions
* Dictionaries
* Loops (while loop)
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Random module
* Data handling

**Description:**

In this project, the program randomly selects two entities (e.g., celebrities, brands, or organizations) and displays their details except follower count. The player must guess which one has more followers. If the guess is correct, the score increases and the game continues; otherwise, the game ends.

**Example:**

* Compare A: Instagram (Social media platform)
* Compare B: Cristiano Ronaldo (Footballer)

Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B'

Answer: B ✅
Score: 1

**What I learned:**

* Working with complex data (dictionaries)
* Building continuous game loops
* Using randomness for dynamic gameplay
* Improving decision-making logic in programs

* Dictionaries
* Loops (while loop)
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Data handling
* Modular programming

**Description:**

In this project, the program acts like a coffee machine. The user can choose a drink (espresso, latte, cappuccino), and the machine checks if enough resources (water, milk, coffee) are available. The user inserts coins, and if the payment is sufficient, the drink is served and resources are updated. The program continues running until turned off.

**Example:**

* Select drink: latte
* Insert coins: $100
* Cost: $80
* Change returned: $20
* ☕ Here is your latte. Enjoy!
